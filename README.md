# Expense Tracker
## Project Introduction

This project is a simple expense tracker that allows users to create an accout where they can keep track of personal expenses and analyze their spending habits.
The project is coded in Java and utilizes the Swing API to deliver the application in an easy to use graphical user interface.

## Prerequisites

You will need a way to run the program which is written in Java. I recommend an IDE such as Eclipse for this purpose.

## Installation

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine. (https://github.com/rnmurthy1996/ExpenseTracker.git)
2. Run the file ExpenseTrackerRunner.java in your IDE to launch the application.

## Using Application

When the user runs the program, the first window they will see is the login GUI.

They will then have the option of logging in with an existing account or creating a new account. For demonstration purposes, we will create a new account first by clicking on the "Create Account" button. The new window that will pop up is the create account GUI. The user must now enter a username and password to create their account.

Once you have successfully created an account, you will be returned to the login GUI where you can login by entering the username and password for the account you created and clicking the "Login" button.

Once you have succesfully logged in, you wil be directed to the home page GUI which contains options to either add an expense item to your account, remove an existing expense item, view your spending statistics, and exit the application. You will also see a list of all expenses associated with your account.

To add an expense, click the "Add Expense" button. The add expense GUI will open in which the user will enter the date and description of their expense, its spend category, and the cost. Once this information is entered and the "Add Expense" button is clicked, the expense is added to your account and the list on the home screen is updated.

To remove an expense, click the "Remove Expense" button. The remove expense GUI will open in which the user will choose the expense they want to remove from their account. Once this choice is made and the "Remove Expense" button is clicked, the expense is deleted from your account and the list on the home screen is updated.
